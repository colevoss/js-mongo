# js-mongo

This is a work in progress project. If you want to work on it cool.

To see kinda whats going on here, check out `test/User.js` to see examples of using the `Document` class and the `Schema` class utility.

Pretty much, I want to create a ODM that doesn't get too much in the way.

The Schema utility is heavily influenced by React's [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) with a couple additions.
